    <p><b>Welcome to Love and Lemons! </b>My name is chamodhi, and I created Love and Lemons to celebrate how nourishing, fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. You’ll find a host of inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want Love and Lemons to be a resource for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and tips for cooking plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils.

        And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! In my opinion, healthy eating is all about balance, so you’ll find recipes for<b>brownies, cakes, cookies</b>, and more here too.</p>
   
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>

        <h3>Do I have to be vegetarian to enjoy the recipes?</h3>
        <p>Nope! My meat-eating husband Jack is my #1 taste tester, and he gives each recipe his stamp of approval before I share it. In addition, many of my friends, family, and recipe testers are not vegetarian, and they all try these recipes. Everything you see here is 100% omnivore-approved! When you’re cooking with good-quality seasonal ingredients, the results are going to taste great, whether you’re vegetarian or not.</p>

        <h3>What if I’m vegan or gluten-free?</h3>

        <h3>Are you on social media?</h3>
        <p>You betcha! Follow along on <b>Instagram, Facebook, or Pinterest</b>.</p>

        <h3>Where do you grocery shop?</h3>
        <p>I live in Chicago, and in the summertime, we have fantastic local farmers markets and CSA options here. My favorites are the <b>Lincoln Park and Logan Square markets</b>. But because of Chicago’s cold climate, these markets aren’t open year-round. In the winter, I shop at Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Marianos, or Jewel</p>

        <h3>What’s your favorite food?</h3>
        <p>Juicy summer peaches are my all-time favorite food. (If you’re lucky enough to have some right now, try them in my <b>peach cobbler or peach salsa. Sweet Corn</b> is a close second</p>
