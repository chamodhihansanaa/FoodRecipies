    <h2>  Homemade Pizza </h2>

       <p> This homemade pizza recipe is perfect for parties! Everyone loves pizza, and your guests can customize their toppings to suit their personal tastes.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve shared a number of homemade pizza recipes on the blog (see <b>here, here</b>, and <b>here</b>), but never one from start to finish – crust & sauce included. In reality, though, we make pizza from scratch fairly often around here. Why? It’s one of the few meals we eat where we get to spend time in the kitchen together. I do most of the cooking in our house, but when pizza night rolls around, both of us pitch in.</p>

    <h2>Our Video</h2>

    <p>I also love to make pizza when I entertain because, well, everyone loves pizza, and it’s customizable! It’s easy to make different toppings to suit different tastes. You can even get your guests involved in topping their own personal pizzas, so everyone has a hand in the final meal. When <b>Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Cove </b>asked us to create a recipe that celebrates their philosophy of living deliciously, I thought immediately of homemade pizza and my shared time in the kitchen with Jack, friends, and family.</p>

    <p>Taking time out of our busy days to put down our phones and celebrate every glorious flavor, guest, and memory makes me feel like we are truly living deliciously. For me, this also means eating seasonally. I visit local farmers markets to get inspiration for what to cook and what to eat, and in warm weather, Jack and I grow our own herbs on our back deck. How does eating seasonally relate to homemade pizza? Well, while cheese and sausage are the most popular pizza toppings where we live, I embrace summer’s plethora of beautiful vegetables (and even fruits!) to create out-of-the-box fresh combinations. And because we have so many gorgeous herbs right outside our door, I generously top my pizzas with fresh basil, mint, and homemade pesto to add a ton of fresh, delicious flavor.</p>


    <h3>Our Homemade Pizza Dough</h3>
    <p>Of course, there are nights when we pick up pizza dough from the store. But the best pizza nights are the ones when we make the dough ourselves – especially because it means that we work together in the kitchen. Jack (our resident dough man) will mix up the homemade pizza dough while I prep the toppings and the sauce. When we sit down to eat, it’s so fun to enjoy a meal we made together!<br>
        Our <b>homemade pizza dough recipe </b>uses simple ingredients like all-purpose flour, yeast, a little sugar, warm water, salt, and olive oil. It yields a crust that’s crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and perfectly golden brown</p>




    <h3>Homemade Pizza Toppings</h3>
    <p>As I said above, I live deliciously by eating with the seasons. Homemade pizza is something we enjoy together all year round, but right now, we have an abundance of herbs growing outside our back door. Greenhouse cherry tomatoes are popping up at the farmers markets, too. With these fresh, seasonal ingredients as a starting point, I created three topping combinations:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Margherita Pizza –</li><p>With local cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil from the backyard, this classic pizza is juicy, slightly sweet & totally delicious.</p>
        <li>Roasted Red Pepper Pesto Pizza – </li><p>Using mint & basil from outside, I blended up a super green pesto that paired perfectly with Wisconsin smoked mozzarella & homemade roasted red peppers. I couldn’t resist adding some extra mint leaves for garnish!</p>
        <li>Peach & Basil Pizza –</li><p>I’m head over heels for peaches, so with all the basil outside, I had to make this super simple peach & basil pie. Dollops of the pesto from the red pepper pizza added just the right finishing touch here too</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Our Homemade Pizza Sauce</h3>
    <p>To support our seasonal toppings, we needed a flavorful sauce. In this homemade pizza recipe, I use pesto as the base of the red pepper pizza, while I simply brush the crust of the peach pizza with olive oil. For a good margherita pizza, though, red sauce is a must.<br>
        <b>Our homemade pizza sauce recipe uses simple ingredients: San Marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, salt, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of dried oregano</b>. Pulse them together in the food processor, and you’re ready to spread your sauce on your dough! I opt not to cook the sauce before baking so that the freshness of the sweet tomatoes and garlic can really shine. The flavors mellow and meld just the right amount while the pizza is in the oven, so no stovetop time is necessary!</p>
